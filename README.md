# hh-sync

a command-line utility for syncing workouts from Endomondo to [HeiaHeia](https://www.heiaheia.com) and [Kilometrikisa](https://www.kilometrikisa.fi)

## Important!

The utility asks you to provide credentials to all services it needs to have access to. They are stored locally and sent only to these services using HTTPS connection. But, when given, they are stored in plain text in `~/.hh-sync` folder. **Make sure you keep these files safe.**

## Good to know

 - You can run syncing in interactive mode using `--interactive` flag. When provided, you will be asked to confirm syncing of every workout detected to be new.

 - By default, the untility searches new workouts only within a window of last 20 workouts. You can change that behaviour by giving `--depth` option.

## Installation

 - Download the [hh-sync](https://github.com/propan/hh-sync/blob/stable/hh-sync) script
 - Place it on your $PATH where your shell can find it (eg. ~/bin)
 - Set it to be executable (chmod a+x ~/bin/lein)
 - Run it (hh-sync) and it will download the self-install package
